1. Testing data files are contained in `test_files` and training data is contained in `train_files` on box.com.  Too large to be stored on github.com

2. 'main.py' is evaluating and processing the binary files, and merging the so-far 2 classes for our CNN model  

3. 'keras_cnn.py' is the actual cnn model that we will use.

4. `knn_binary.py` is the knn model for the two image comparison, `knn_total.py` is the knn model for the four image comparison.
